# Tera Online FIX DataCenter 33.
 This Datacenter file fixes partial translation issues as well as __removes camera shakes__ from character skills and game dungeons.
 <br/> 
 It also __removes zoom effects from characters__ like Reaper and Gunner, in addition to __modifying the HURRICANE effect__ by adding a fast fire aura around the boss to indicate when it is active (don't be alarmedðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘Œ). The hurricane icon has also been changed in this version to a more visible icon.
 
> ### Remember!
